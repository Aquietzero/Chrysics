# Issues for the Project

Here are pieces of ideas of how to improve the project or notedowns of the problems I met while developing **Chrysics**.

The project has been undergone for about 3 months. Through those months, I just kept implementing separating functionalities. So problems are little, or they were just some implementing problem. But with the project grows every day, I began to stuck in some design problems. Hence I want to note them down for future reference.
